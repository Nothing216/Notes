first mini jump because e- removed from inner subshell (lower energy level, less shielding so more energy needed). from 5-6 the gradient is less as the increase in energy is not as much as 4-5. increase in energy due to subshell>increase in energy due to a more positive atom
### Period 3
- $$Al_2Cl_6{(s)} \xrightarrow[Just\ Sublimes]{heat} Al_2Cl_6(g) \xrightarrow{more\ heat}AlCl_3(g) $$
- Al2Cl6 makes pH of water 4 when added as HCl(g) is produced
- $$Al_2O_3\ +\ 2NaOH \rightarrow \ NaAlO_2\ +\ H_2O$$
- $$Al_2O_3\ +\ 2NaOH\ +\ 3H_2O\ \rightarrow\ 2NaAl(OH)_4 $$
- $$\ce{ZnO + 2NaOH -> Na2ZnO2 + H2O}$$
- $$\ce{ZnO + 2NaOH + H2O -> Na2Zn(OH)4}$$
- there is trend in electrical conductivity even among non-metals
## Environmental Chem
- NO2+CO-> N2+CO2 (unbalanced)
- NO+CO->N2+CO2(unbalanced)
- volatile organic compounds are unburnt hydrocarbons
## Analytical techniques
* Fragments have +
* $$
 Number\ of\  carbon\ atoms\ in\ a\ molecule= \frac{100}{1.1} \times \frac{abundance\ of\ [M+1]^+\ ion}{abundance\ of\ M^+\ ion}
$$

in mass spectroscopy, these types of cuts are unlikely so never choose them. the purple line is the cut


## Practical
* when asked if pipette will make results more accurate, it will not if the substance being added is added in excess
* 

## Equilibrium
![[Pasted image 20250219153930.png]]
0.13 of H2 reacted and 0.13 of I2 reacted so left is 0.07 and 0.02 which is conc of reactants and conc of product is 0.26
- Lets say 3 gases H, I, and N occupy a cylinder. Partial pressure of H is the pressure of H if it alone occupied the cylinder.
- for Kc calculations, we dont use any liquids or solids that appear in the equation
- units for Kp can be Pa or atm
- Definition: rate of forward reaction is equal to rate of backward reaction in a closed system. Concentration of reactants and products remain constant.
-  we can use n=vc for gases
- when sum of molar ratios on left and right side are equal, we can use moles to calculate Kc instead of Conc as V cancels out

## Chemical Bonding
- bond angle of hydrogen bond must look like 180 degrees when drawing
- Cis isomer is always more polar
- Van der waals= intermolecular forces->HB,PDPD,IDID
- For 2 molecules to mix, the forces between the molecules in the 2 individual liquids l must be equal to or less than the forces between the molecules after theyve mixed

#### Bucky Balls
Structure:
- Simple molecular
- Spherical molecule
- Hexagonal arragement
- 1 carbon atom bonded to 3 other carbon atoms COVALENTLY

Low sublimation point:
- weak intermolecular forces between balls

soft:
- weak intermolecular forces between balls

Conductivity:
- poor electrical conductor as delocalisation is less than graphite

Solubility:
- soluble in organic solvents

Reactivity:
- more reactive than carbon and graphite because of high electron density
#### Hydrogen Bonding
- Rule: One molecule must have an $H^{\delta+}$atom bonded to FON. That H atom then forms a hydrogen bond with a lone pair of a FON$^{\delta-}$ on another molecule
- ![[Pasted image 20250407193438.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250407193704.png]]
- hydrogen bond angle always 180
- Avg H bonds per molecule:
	- H2O: 2
	- HF: 1
	- NH3: 1
- To find avg bonds per molecule we find ratio of lone pairs to $H^{\delta+}$. The lowest value of the 2 is the avg hydrogen bonds per molecule
- HF has a strong hydrogen bond than H2O and NH3 as F is more electronegative but H2O has more average hydrogen bonds per molecule than HF so H2O has higher BP than HF
#### Properties of water due to hydrogen bonds
- High surface tension: water molecules on the surface are being pulled by ones below thru H bonds. Downward force at the surface
- Ice is less dense than gas as hydrogen bonds form a rigid lattice(each oxygen atom is surrounded by a tetrahedron of hydrogen atoms) that has a more spaced out arrangement as hydrogen bond lengths are very large so H2O molecules are further apart from each other in ice compared to water
- relatively high viscosity as hydrogen bonds make it harder for water molecules to slide over one another

## Moles
* density of a gas at rtp can be found like this: 
$$ n=\frac{mass}{molar\ mass}=\frac{volume}{24} \
$$
$$
density=\frac{mass}{volume}=\frac{molar\ mass}{24}
$$

The number of mole of each ion is 0.005 mol in Fe2(SO4)3 and since there are 2 mols of iron(III) ions in Fe2(SO4)3 no. of mols of Fe3+=2 * 0.005=0.01.

ratio is 1:4 so we multiply the zinc equation by 4 to get the total number of electrons that one mol of Cr2O7^2- is gonna take. each Cr atom is gonna take 4e- so oxidation decreases by 4. 
* if there are 2 nonmetals, the more electronegative nonmetal gets the negative oxidation sign
* Oxygen is always -2 unless with fluorine or H2O2
* H is always +1 unless hydride

## States of Matter
- pV=nrT, v is in m^3 
- ![[Pasted image 20250406132156.png]]
- Initial dip as low pressure=low volume, imf is more significant as less distance between molecules. so it decreases the volume even more
- exponential increase as molecules have volume so when pressure is kept on increasing at one point volume doesnt decrease proportionally. pV, p increases but V decreases very little or stays same so pV as a whole increases
- at higher temperatures, intermolecular forces are less significant so its closer to ideal gas line
- 
## Enthalpy
- enthalpy change of formation of an oxide= enthalpy change of combustion of element
- precipitation involves energy change
![[Pasted image 20250317151535.png]]
## Organic
#### Intro
- Having even number of electrons $\neq$ not free radical 
- Racemic mixture has both optical isomers in equal amounts such that their effect is cancelled out
- Dichromate cannot oxidise alkenes
- HCl gas is not good to make chloroalkane from alcohol
- branched molecules have lower mps as distance id id forces act on is larger and there are less contact points. they are more spaced out
- 2^n for chiral and geometric isomers where n is the number of stereo centers
- Transition state forms when 2 molecules or ions collide
- in a transition state of SN2 the carbon atom is bonded to 5 other atoms partially or fully
- n moles of monomer produces less than n moles of polymer

breaking C-Cl bond has a very high Ea compared to Ea needed for C+ alkane to react with OH-

### Organic Shortcuts
Alkane ratio is $C_n H_{2n}$ 
Cyclic removes 2H from alkane ratio
double bond removes 2H
2 cyclic rings remove 2H 
ketone, aldehyde, acid removes 2H
haloalkane removes 1 H dihaloalkane removes 2H and so on
CH2 is 14 molar mass and CH3 is 15 
carboxylic acid needs 4H to reduce as it needs to remove an O atom

#### Redox shortcuts
oxidation to carboxylic acid: 2H lost 1 O gained
oxidation to aldehyde or ketone: 2H lost only

## Enthalpy Change
- when using weaker acid, enthalpy of neutralisation is lower than stronger acid as energy is needed to dissociate weak acid 
- H++OH- enthalpy change is constant
