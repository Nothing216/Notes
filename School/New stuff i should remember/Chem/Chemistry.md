### Period 3
- $$Al_2Cl_6{(s)} \xrightarrow[Just\ Sublimes]{heat} Al_2Cl_6(g) \xrightarrow{more\ heat}AlCl_3(g) $$
- Al2Cl6 makes pH of water 4 when added as HCl(g) is produced
## Environmental Chem
- NO2+CO-> N2+CO2 (unbalanced)
- NO+CO->N2+CO2(unbalanced)
- volatile organic compounds are unburnt hydrocarbons
## Analytical techniques
* Fragments have +
* $$
 Number\ of\  carbon\ atoms\ in\ a\ molecule= \frac{100}{1.1} \times \frac{abundance\ of\ [M+1]^+\ ion}{abundance\ of\ M^+\ ion}
$$

in mass spectroscopy, these types of cuts are unlikely so never choose them. the purple line is the cut


## Practical
* when asked if pipette will make results more accurate, it will not if the substance being added is added in excess
* 

## Equilibrium
![[Pasted image 20250219153930.png]]
0.13 of H2 reacted and 0.13 of I2 reacted so left is 0.07 and 0.02 which is conc of reactants and conc of product is 0.26
- Lets say 3 gases H, I, and N occupy a cylinder. Partial pressure of H is the pressure of H if it alone occupied the cylinder.
- for Kc calculations, we dont use any liquids or solids that appear in the equation
- units for Kp can be Pa or atm
- Definition: rate of forward reaction is equal to rate of backward reaction in a closed system. Concentration of reactants and products remain constant.
-  we can use n=vc for gases
- when sum of molar ratios on left and right side are equal, we can use moles to calculate Kc instead of Conc as V cancels out

## Chemical Bonding
- bond angle of hydrogen bond must look like 180 degrees when drawing
- Cis isomer is always more polar
- Van der waals= intermolecular forces->HB,PDPD,IDID

## Moles
* density of a gas at rtp can be found like this: 
$$ n=\frac{mass}{molar\ mass}=\frac{volume}{24} \
$$
$$
density=\frac{mass}{volume}=\frac{molar\ mass}{24}
$$

The number of mole of each ion is 0.005 mol in Fe2(SO4)3 and since there are 2 mols of iron(III) ions in Fe2(SO4)3 no. of mols of Fe3+=2 * 0.005=0.01.

ratio is 1:4 so we multiply the zinc equation by 4 to get the total number of electrons that one mol of Cr2O7^2- is gonna take. each Cr atom is gonna take 4e- so oxidation decreases by 4. 
* if there are 2 nonmetals, the more electronegative nonmetal gets the negative oxidation sign
* Oxygen is always -2 unless with fluorine or H2O2
* H is always +1 unless hydride

## States of Matter
- pV=nrT, v is in m^3 
- ![[Pasted image 20250406132156.png]]
- Initial dip as low pressure=low volume, imf is more significant as less distance between molecules. 
- exponential increase as molecules have volume so when pressure is kept on increasing at one point volume doesnt decrease proportionally. pV, p increases but V decreases very little or stays same so pV as a whole increases
## Enthalpy

## Organic
#### Intro
- Having even number of electrons $\neq$ not free radical 
- Racemic mixture has both optical isomers in equal amounts such that their effect is cancelled out
- Dichromate cannot oxidise alkenes
- HCl gas is not good to make chloroalkane from alcohol
- branched molecules have lower mps as distance id id forces act on is larger and there are less contact points. they are more spaced out
- 2^n for chiral and geometric isomers where n is the number of stereo centers
- Transition state forms when 2 molecules or ions collide
- in a transition state of SN2 the carbon atom is bonded to 5 other atoms partially or fully
- n moles of monomer produces less than n moles of polymer

breaking C-Cl bond has a very high Ea compared to Ea needed for C+ alkane to react with OH-

### Organic Shortcuts
Alkane ratio is $C_n H_{2n}$ 
Cyclic removes 2H from alkane ratio
double bond removes 2H
2 cyclic rings remove 2H 
ketone, aldehyde, acid removes 2H
haloalkane removes 1 H dihaloalkane removes 2H and so on
CH2 is 14 molar mass and CH3 is 15 
carboxylic acid needs 4H to reduce as it needs to remove an O atom

#### Redox shortcuts
oxidation to carboxylic acid: 2H lost 1 O gained
oxidation to aldehyde or ketone: 2H lost only

## Enthalpy Change
- when using weaker acid, enthalpy of neutralisation is lower than stronger acid as energy is needed to dissociate weak acid 
- H++OH- enthalpy change is constant
