### Physical Quantities and Units
- When they say which quantity is correct with its units, the unit may be given in a broken down form  in terms of other units
- a homogenous equation has same base units on both sides
- an equation can be homogenous but incorrect if it has a missing coefficient(1/2) or missing term (ut)

### Kinematics
- south of east, east of south, bearing can be used to describe angles
- -ve acceleration $\neq$ deceleration
- ![[Pasted image 20250215122806.png]]
- deceleration is when the direction of acceleration is opposite to direction of velocity. in the third example acc is -ve but its not dec
- Displacement's direction is always from measuring point to current point and does not depend on direction of velocity or acceleration
- ![[Pasted image 20250215123707.png]]
- direction of acceleration depends on direction of force
- average velocity is $\frac{total\ displacement}{total\ time}$
- ![[Pasted image 20250215125803.png]]
A: velocity is in the negative region so it is -ve. the velocity graph has a negative graident as the displacement is decreasing more and more every second so the gradient is decreasing, so velocity is decreasing (at a constant rate). so acceleration and velocity are negative. if both are -ve then it is acceleration
![[Pasted image 20250215130320.png]]
B: use same logic as A
C: Gradient is -ve and velocity +ve so has to be deceleration. the negative gradient is increasing so dec increasing
D: use same logic as A
- $$average\ speed=\frac{u+v}{2}$$
### Dynamics
- always consider if opp direction when finding $\Delta$P, if so then the momentums are added
Resultant Force=0 when a closed vector triangle can be formed
![[Pasted image 20250215121711.png]]
- the resultant force of two vectors in a triangle is always the third vector when in equilibrium. the crossed on is not in equilibrium
- Resultant Moment=0 when all extrapolated forces intersect at a point
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Newtons third law
	1. Action and reaction are equal
	2. They are opposite
	3. They act on 2 diff objects
	4. They have same type of force
	5. They have same line of action
	6. They have same time of action

### Forces, density and pressure
- rocket? think of fuel's mass

### Work Energy Power
- always consider work done against gravity if the object is on a slope
- 

### Deformation of solids
- strain energy=EPE
- work done in force-extension graph is

### Waves
- when mentioning path difference also mention phase difference
- when talking about interference **pattern** dont mention intensity
- be careful about what unit phase difference is needed in the answer box
- Understand difference between displacement and amplitude
	eg: what is antinode of stat wave?
	Ans: ||point of max amplitude and not max displacement as points of minimum displacement are also antinodes||
* Condition for formation of stationary wave: 
	1. 2 or more waves moving in opposite directions
	2. waves of same frequency
	3. waves of same speed
	4. overlap
	5. same type of wave
- adjacent particles are in phase for stat and not in phase for prog
- no energy is transferred in stat waves
- If frequency of a wave is decreased and they ask what is seen on the cro dont say wavelength is increased say time period is increased 
- 2 waves meet at a point P with  path difference 5/2 $\lambda$ and they start at the source point in phase. Now the phase difference of the waves at their source point is 180 degrees. what happens at P?
	Ans: ||the waves are in phase at P. Explanation: whenever two waves start in phase and meet at a point in phase/out of phase, if the phase difference at source becomes 180 they will arrive at the same point out of phase/in phase||
- Dopplers effect definition: The change in observed frequency of a wave due to the motion of the source of the wave **relative to the observer.**
- In a stat wave, each particle has a different amplitude which varies from max to 0 
- if phase diff is x then 360-x is also phase difference
- Difference between to points on a CRO represents the difference in time between them (time gap)
### Electricity
- I-v characteristic of diode: Zero current in one direction, current increases non-linearly with increasing gradient when voltage is increased
- power ratio formulas:
	- Series: PowerA:PowerB=ResistanceA:ResistanceB
	- Parallel: PowerA:PowerB=ResistanceB:ResistanceA
- Lost Volts: voltage drop due to internal resistance
- When explaining why voltage for a certain component goes down when resistance of another component is increased, say that current decreases and V=IR and R of the component is constant.
- When a battery is connected with same voltage parallely to a circuit, the current in the circuit is the same as the total emf of the circuit is still 6v. however, the current in each battery decreases as the current from the 2 batteries add up to form the same current when only 1 battery was being used.![[Pasted image 20250127190051.png]]
- Quantisation of Charge: Any amount of charge is an integer multiple of elementary charge.
- If there are total of 3 identical resistors in a circuit and 2 of them are replaced by resistors that have 1/4 * R. Then current does not increase by a factor of 1/4 as total resistance, which depends on all 3 resistors, decreases by a factor less than 1/4.
- Thermal energy/power dissipated by a battery and energy/power dissipated by a battery are different. To find thermal energy dissipated, we use $$\frac{v^2}{r}t \ or\ I^2rt$$where r is internal resistance
- To find the R of resistor in parallel where the other resistor's resistance is known, the voltage is known and the current is known: $$\frac{V}{R_1}+\frac{V}{R_2}=I$$
