-  Coding Data means to add, subtract, multiply or divide a constant from all the values of a data set so that we can work with it more easily
* $$x=101, 103, 104,108,111 
$$
$$
(x-100)=1, 3, 4, 8, 11
$$
Mean of (x-100) is 100 less than mean of x as the mean shifts according to how much each value shifts

$$ \bar{x}=\frac{\Sigma{(x-100)}}{5}+100
$$
+100 to shift the mean 100 steps

phi(z) where z is not on table

* $$\phi(z)\ where\ z\ is \ correct\ to\ 3dp$$
$$\phi^{-1}(x)\ where \ x\ is\ correct\ to\ 4sf$$
* accuracy of values of μ and σ are very important. slight differences give much different answers. keep them correct to 3sf by using 4sf in calculations
* nq and pq need to be more than 5 
* dont forget to label x and y axis of fd graph
* N~($\mu,\sigma^2$ )
* $\mu$=1/p for geometric
* mode of geometric is 1
* $$P(x\le r)\ means\ 1-q^r$$
* $$P(x> r)\ means\ q^r$$
