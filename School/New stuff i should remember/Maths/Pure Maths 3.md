- Try not to square both sides for absolute value questions instead use graph
- IMPORTANT BINOMIAL EXPANSION NEGATIVE POWERS FIND RANGE OF X FOR WHICH ITS VALID
- sometimes arg between two vectors cannot be found so you subtract argA-argB get arg(A/B) and then find arg
- Differentiating 
- $$2y\cdot \frac{dy}{dx}$$
$$
=2y \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + 2 \left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)^2
$$

- In implicit differentiation, when finding coordinates of turning point, always input the x and y coordinates in the dy/dx expression to see if you get 0. This is specially needed when dy/dx is a fraction and has x in the denominator
- When turning into $sin(\theta\pm\alpha)$ have sin first then cos and for $cos(\theta\mp\alpha)$ have cos first then sin
- $asin(\theta)\pm bcos(\theta)=Rsin(\theta\pm\alpha)$ 
- $acos(\theta)\pm bsin(\theta)=Rcos(\theta\mp\alpha)$ 
- always $tan(\theta)=\frac{b}{a}$ 
- Polar forms:
	- modulus argument form: r and theta
	- exponential form: e
