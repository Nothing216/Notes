- Try not to square both sides for absolute value questions instead use graph
- sometimes arg between two vectors cannot be found so you subtract argA-argB get arg(A/B) and then find arg
- Differentiating 
- $$2y\cdot \frac{dy}{dx}$$
$$=2\cdot(\frac{dy}{dx})^2$$
- In implicit differentiation, when finding coordinates of turning point, always input the x and y coordinates in the dy/dx expression to see if you get 0. This is specially needed when dy/dx is a fraction and has x in the denominator
