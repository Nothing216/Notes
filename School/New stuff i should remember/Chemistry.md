## Environmental Chem
- NO2+CO-> N2+CO2 (unbalanced)
- NO+CO->N2+CO2(unbalanced)
## Analytical techniques
* Fragments have +

## Practical
* when asked if pipette will make results more accurate, it will not if the substance being added is added in excess

## Equilibrium

0.13 of H2 reacted and 0.13 of I2 reacted so left is 0.07 and 0.02 which is conc of reactants and conc of product is 0.26
## Chemical Bonding

$$
 Number\ of\  carbon\ atoms\ in\ a\ molecule= \frac{100}{1.1} \times \frac{abundance\ of\ [M+1]^+\ ion}{abundance\ of\ M^+\ ion}
$$
## Moles
* density of a gas at rtp can be found like this: 
$$ n=\frac{mass}{molar\ mass}=\frac{volume}{24} \
$$
$$
density=\frac{mass}{volume}=\frac{molar\ mass}{24}
$$

The number of mole of each ion is 0.005 mol in Fe2(SO4)3 and since there are 2 mols of iron(III) ions in Fe2(SO4)3 no. of mols of Fe3+=2 * 0.005=0.01.

ratio is 1:4 so we multiply the zinc equation by 4 to get the total number of electrons that one mol of Cr2O7^2- is gonna take. each Cr atom is gonna take 4e- so oxidation decreases by 4. 
* if there are 2 nonmetals, the more electronegative nonmetal gets the negative oxidation sign
* Oxygen is always -2 unless with fluorine or H2O2
* H is always +1 unless hydride

## States of Matter
- pV=nrT, v is in m^3 
## Equilibrium
- we can use n=vc for gases
- when sum of molar ratios on left and right side are equal, we can use moles to calculate Kc instead of Conc as V cancels out
## Organic
#### Intro
- Racemic mixture has both optical isomers in equal amounts such that their effect is cancelled out
- Dichromate cannot oxidise alkenes
- branched molecules have lower mps as distance id id forces act on is larger and there are less contact points. they are more spaced out
- 2^n for chiral and geometric isomers where n is the number of stereo centers
