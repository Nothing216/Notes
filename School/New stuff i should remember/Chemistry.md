## Analytical techniques
* Fragments have +

## Practical
* when asked if pipette will make results more accurate, it will not if the substance being added is added in excess

## Chemical Bonding

$$
 Number\ of\  carbon\ atoms\ in\ a\ molecule= \frac{100}{1.1} \times \frac{abundance\ of\ [M+1]^+\ ion}{abundance\ of\ M^+\ ion}
$$
## Moles
* density of a gas at rtp can be found like this: 
$$ n=\frac{mass}{molar\ mass}=\frac{volume}{24} \
$$
$$
density=\frac{mass}{volume}=\frac{molar\ mass}{24}
$$

The number of mole of each ion is 0.005 mol in Fe2(SO4)3 and since there are 2 mols of iron(III) ions in Fe2(SO4)3 no. of mols of Fe3+=2 * 0.005=0.01.

ratio is 1:4 so we multiply the zinc equation by 4 to get the total number of electrons that one mol of Cr2O7^2- is gonna take. each Cr atom is gonna take 4e- so oxidation decreases by 4. 
* if there are 2 nonmetals, the more electronegative nonmetal gets the negative oxidation sign

## Organic
#### Intro
- Racemic mixture has both optical isomers in equal amounts such that their effect is cancelled out
